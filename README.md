# Feature Tracking with OpenCV (Beginner Demos)

This repository contains beginner-friendly demos of **corner detection** and **optical flow tracking** using OpenCV and Python.  
It is part of my learning journey into **Computer Vision** and **Visual-Inertial Navigation Systems (VINS)**.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Shiâ€“Tomasi Corner Detection** (`cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack`)
- **Lucasâ€“Kanade Optical Flow** (`cv2.calcOpticalFlowPyrLK`)
- Three runnable demos:
  1. **Corner Detection on Uploaded Image**  
     Upload an image (e.g., building facade) and detect feature corners.  
  2. **Synthetic Checkerboard Tracking**  
     Generate a moving checkerboard and track features across frames.  
  3. **Shifted Real Image Tracking**  
     Download a real image, synthetically shift it, and track features.
